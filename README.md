Cosmic Web Dev Quiz - An Immersive 3D Experience
This project is a highly creative, immersive quiz game designed as the capstone for the first week of my #30DayCodingChallenge. It reimagines the standard quiz format as a "Cosmic Exploration" mission, where the user journeys through a 3D starfield, answering web development questions presented as incoming transmissions.

üöÄ Project Overview
This is not just a quiz; it's an interactive experience. The goal was to create something completely unique by blending a functional application with creative, high-tech visuals and sound design. The user takes on the role of a starship captain on a mission to test their coding knowledge across different star systems.

Key Features:
Immersive 3D Starfield: A dynamic, multi-layered starfield created with three.js serves as the background, providing a constant sense of forward motion.

Randomized Question Bank: The quiz pulls 10 random questions from a larger pool of 20, ensuring every "mission" is unique and replayable.

Futuristic HUD Interface: The entire quiz is presented within a Heads-Up Display, featuring a "typing" effect for questions to simulate incoming transmissions.

"Warp Speed" Transitions: Clicking the "Next" button accelerates the starfield, creating an exciting animated transition to the next question.

Thematic Sound Effects: Custom sound effects synthesized with Tone.js provide audio feedback for correct/incorrect answers, enhancing the sci-fi atmosphere.

üíª Technologies Used
HTML5: For the semantic structure of the HUD.

Tailwind CSS: For all utility-first styling and layout.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all application logic, including quiz state management, DOM manipulation, and coordinating animations and sound.

Three.js: A 3D graphics library used to create and animate the immersive starfield background.

Tone.js: A Web Audio framework used to synthesize the sci-fi sound effects in real-time.
